There are many like it but this home lab is YOURS! Go ahead, break production. 
Who's going to be upset, your boss? Oh wait, in your home lab, that's you! Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Starting a home lab can feel daunting but it doesn't have to be. Especially with 
the rise in popularity of containerized applications, you can host several services 
on your network with little-to-no setup! 

This repository is a way for me to share my favorite services as well as some common
settings that I like for each of them. I will do my best to "include batteries" where I can. 
That said, be sure to check for a `DOCS.md` file in the root of each service's folder. 
I'll note any manual install steps, dependencies, configuration considerations, and other 
general notes in these files.

A CYA note for me: I make no promises, hold no responsiblity, and say no prayers for 
your envirnment. Backup your stuff and vet the services on your own. Basically, have fun
and play safe because I won't be there to bail you out when you get an ouchie. 

**Whew**, now that that is out of the way... this is going to be FUN! 

If you're totally new to the home lab scene, I suggest you start with the following services: 

* â›” PiHole - a network-wide add blocker (and DNS resolver) 
* ðŸ’¬ Ollama + Open Web UI - a privately hosted Chat GPT alternative
* ðŸ“„ Blog + Cloudflare Tunnel - host your blog on your own hardware
